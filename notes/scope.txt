x: 5 -- Creates a new variable in the local scope
5 x‚Üê -- Assigns to an existing variable

type Scope = Map VariableName Value
type VariableContext = [Scope] -- Stack of scopes, innermost first

When entering a function or block, a new scope is created.
When exiting, it is destroyed.

When defining a lambda, its variable context is copied,
flattened to a Scope, and set as its closure.
When calling a function, the closure is inserted between
the top of the context and the local function scope.
When the function exits, the possibly modified closure is
saved in an IORef.
